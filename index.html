        Fyodor Dostoyevsky, (born November 11 [October 30, Old Style], 1821, 
        Moscow, Russia —  died February 9 [January 28, Old Style], 1881, St. Petersburg), 
        Russian novelist and short-story writer whose psychological penetration into the 
        darkest recesses of the human heart, together with his unsurpassed moments of illumination, 
        had an immense influence on 20th-century fiction.

    Dostoyevsky is usually regarded as one of the finest 
    novelists who ever lived. Literary modernism, existentialism, 
    and various schools of psychology, theology, and literary criticism 
    have been profoundly shaped by his ideas. His works are often called prophetic 
    because he so accurately predicted how Russias revolutionaries would behave if 
    they came to power. In his time he was also renowned for his activity as a journalist.

<p>
    Dostoyevsky is best known for his novella Notes 
    from the Underground and for four long novels, Crime 
    and Punishment, The Idiot, The Possessed (also and more accurately 
    known as The Demons and The Devils), and The Brothers Karamazov. 
    Each of these works is famous for its psychological profundity, and, 
    indeed, Dostoyevsky is commonly regarded as one of the greatest psychologists 
    in the history of literature. He specialized in the analysis of pathological 
    states of mind that lead to insanity, murder, and suicide and in the exploration of 
    the emotions of humiliation, self-destruction, tyrannical domination, and murderous rage. 
    These major works are also renowned as great “novels of ideas” that treat timeless and timely
    issues in philosophy and politics. Psychology and philosophy are closely linked in Dostoyevskys 
    portrayals of intellectuals, who “feel ideas” in the depths of their souls. Finally, these novels 
    broke new ground with their experiments in literary form.

<h2 style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(77, 44, 44);">Early works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky</h2>
<p>
    The first work Dostoyevsky published was a rather free and emotionally intensified translation of Honoré 
    de Balzac’s novel Eugénie Grandet; and the French writer’s oeuvre was to exercise a great influence on 
    his own fiction. Dostoyevsky did not have to toil long in obscurity. No sooner had he written his first
     novella, Bednyye lyudi (1846; Poor Folk), than he was hailed as the great new talent of Russian 
     literature by the most influential critic of his day, the “furious” Vissarion Belinsky.
Three decades later, in The Diary of a Writer, Dostoyevsky recalled the story of his “discovery.” 
After completing Poor Folk, he gave a copy to his friend, Dmitry Grigorovich, who brought it to the 
poet Nikolay Nekrasov. Reading Dostoyevsky’s manuscript aloud, these two writers were overwhelmed by 
the work’s psychological insight and ability to play on the heartstrings. Even though it was 4:00 AM, 
they went straight to Dostoyevsky to tell him his first novella was a masterpiece. Later that day,
 Nekrasov brought Poor Folk to Belinsky. “A new Gogol has appeared!” Nekrasov proclaimed, to which 
 Belinsky replied, “With you, Gogols spring up like mushrooms!” Belinsky soon communicated his enthusiasm 
 to Dostoyevsky: “Do you, you yourself, realize what it is that you have written!” In The Diary of a Writer, 
 Dostoyevsky remembered this as the happiest moment of his life.
Poor Folk, the appeal of which has been overshadowed by Dostoyevsky’s later works, 
is cast in the then already anachronistic form of an epistolary novel. Makar Devushkin, 
a poor copying clerk who can afford to live only in a corner of a dirty kitchen, exchanges 
letters with a young and poor girl, Varvara Dobrosyolova. Her letters reveal that she has already 
been procured once for a wealthy and worthless man, whom, at the end of the novel, she agrees to marry. 
The novel is remarkable for its descriptions of the psychological (rather than just material) effects 
of poverty. Dostoyevsky transformed the techniques Nikolay Gogol used in The Overcoat, the celebrated 
story of a poor copying clerk. Whereas Gogol’s thoroughly comic hero utterly lacks self-awareness, 
Dostoyevsky’s self-conscious hero suffers agonies of humiliation. In one famous scene, Devushkin reads Gogol’s 
story and is offended by it.
